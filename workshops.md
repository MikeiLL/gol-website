The Freeing the Voice workshop developed by Rivka and Mike iLL Kilmer offers physical methods for relaxing, opening and supporting the voice, overlaid with chakra visualization and basic musical theory – including the relationships between different frequencies to one another as well as each individual’s physical facilities.

This two hour workshop is designed for teachers, students and anyone who wishes to strengthen their vocal capabilities and broaden their expressiveness.

Rivka and Mike are professional vocal performers who have studied and practiced Kundalini and Integral Yoga for over 15 years. They perform regionally and internationally with their musical and theatrical act, Mad haPPy.
