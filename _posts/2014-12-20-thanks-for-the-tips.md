Wanna throw some thanks out there:

[Really cool blog](http://jboor.net/brdm/?p=172 "The Best Way to Make a Songbook with LilyPond and LaTeX") that helped me assemble Hymnal.

[Chris](http://rosuav.com/ "Chris Angelico Website") who turned us on to lilypond engraving library.

[Seth Tobocman](http://www.sethtobocman.com/ "Seth Tobocman homepage") did the cover art.

These folks sponsored the project personally:
