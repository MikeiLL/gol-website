Siket says that referencing the mixes by comparing them to similar tracks is key. He mentioned a couple of applications which are designed specifically for this:

[MC Compare](https://www.meldaproduction.com/MCompare) by Melda Productions, which sells for $69.

[ADPTR Audio Metric AB](https://www.plugin-alliance.com/en/products/adptr_metricab.html) from Plugin Alliance, which is $199.

Then thereâ€™s [Reference 4](https://www.sonarworks.com/reference) from Sonar Works, which you can use to calibrate your speakers and/or headphones to remove sonic mirages generated by your specific environment, mixing with a flat, accurate sound.

[Nugen Audio](https://nugenaudio.com/) offer powerful tools in the mastering realm, in particular, [Mastercheck](https://nugenaudio.com/mastercheck/).
