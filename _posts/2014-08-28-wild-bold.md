Come on, come on, come on and take your mamma for a spin
Get up, get in, pick it up pick it up pick it up
The night is young, the whiskey and the bourbon and the gin are flowin’
Sweet don’t pack it in don’t pack it in don’t pack it in don’t pack it in.

The Devil wears a red cap, and dances with a cane
A pocket full ‘o’ morphine and a golden violin
Enticing us to join him if we dare to call his name.
A nostril full ‘o’ coke don’t pack it in,
Don’t pack it in don’t pack it in don’t pack it in.

Party up, hey. Party up, hey.
Party up, you wild and bold.
It’s back to work on Monday
So all the way through Sunday
We’ll dance and stomp our feet don’t pack it in,
Don’t pack it in don’t pack it in don’t pack it in.

Our friends are just arriving from the night shift
The waitresses and barkeeps a fight
Break it up, break it up, break it up, break it up.
The pimps and poets, the dealers and whores,
The crazies and the cops don’t pack it in
Don’t pack it in don’t pack it in don’t pack it in.

Party up, hey. Party up, hey.
Party up, you wild and bold.
It’s back to work on Monday
So all the way through Sunday
We’ll dance and stomp our feet don’t pack it in,
Don’t pack it in don’t pack it in don’t pack it in.

Seek relief; mistreated in the belly of the beast
All week, in heat burnin’ up, burnin’ up, burnin’ up,
Release control, relinquishing control
Release another scream into the din,
Don’t pack it in don’t pack it in don’t pack it in.

Party up, hey. Party up, hey.
Etc…
