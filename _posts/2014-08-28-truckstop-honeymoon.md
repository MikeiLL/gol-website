it ain’t like things changed much once we hit the road  
being too broke for a coffee and a roll  
that don’t slow you down, just more o-the same stubborn forward march  
maxxed out cards and empty bank accounts, only leave a psychic mark  
late morning in the parking lot at a place called flying j  
nuzzled under the interstate with an all you can eat buffet  
aside from the sun, noone cares if we sleep till twelve or one, and  
the drive, town-ta-town, helps me forget where i came from  
wasn’t raised on a runcible spoon  
a year and a day on a truck stop honeymoon

everything we had to spend  
we spent on a one way ticket  
now we’re down and out, high n’ dry  
with nuthin’ but our looks to get us by

if i’m gonna starve tonight  
then i wanna starve by your side  
drinkin’ truck stop coffee  
and i tell you it’s all right  
you know that you look gorgeous when ya’ cry

if this is what they call freedom i’ll take it  
if this is bad as it gets we’ll make it  
every single turn somethin’s testin’ me  
fates just jealous cause we’re spendin’  
all our time chasin’ signs for destiny

we were nearly half insane and broke down  
by the time we left our strange hometowns  
living at the edge of bored to death in a place called no surprise  
where the only thing that ever changes is what gets you high  
I’d already kicked dope and crack and a bad slut habit… twice, at least  
and i’d just been replaced by a proper queen at a west side hair salon  
if we had what to lose, it was getting old on mary-jane and jack  
and away was the only worthwhile place to get.  
wasn’t raised on a runcible spoon  
a year and a day on a truck stop honeymoon

if i ever knew your strength  
if i ever believed in your resolve  
to achieve even your wildest dreams  
nothing is as dire as it seems

even as the sky turns pink  
on another night here at the brink  
we’ve got love to make  
records to break  
nothin’ but romance to fill the hours

if this is what they call freedom i’ll take it  
if this is bad as it gets we’ll make it  
every single turn somethin’s testin’ me  
fates just jealous cause we’re spendin’  
all our time chasin’ signs for destiny
