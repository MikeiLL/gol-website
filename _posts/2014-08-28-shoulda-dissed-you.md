I should have dissed you,

A long time ago x 2
But I’m still hangin’ on;
For what, I don’t know.

You’re so sorry,
You messed up again.
You’re so sorry,
You haven’t got a friend.
You’re so sorry,
You say it again,
But I’m too tired
To hear it this time.

You love me, you love me, you love me.
Those words you’ll never mean.
They sound as hollow as the deadest tree,
In the dead of winter on the darkest night.
You make me mad.
You’re fuckin’ sorry.
You’re fuckin’ story is gettin’ old.

I should have dissed you…

Brrrrrr na na na nah
You’re lookin fine in the city light.
Feelin’ good in the neon light
Feelin’ bold, ya actin’ bad,
You’re so smooth, it’s makin’ me mad.

I see you clearly in the light of day.
Your story’s written in the lines on your face.
All the people that ya used and dismissed,
Won’t be around to listen to you say that,
You’re so sorry,
You messed up again.
You’re so sorry,
You haven’t got a friend.
You’re so sorry, and that’s the truth.
You’re so sorry, I’m sorry for you.

I shoulda dissed you…
