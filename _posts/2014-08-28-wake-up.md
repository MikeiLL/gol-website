fighting biting out o control  
loosin my teeth losin my soul  
the old witch knows what i’ll go through  
she’s seen the end and she’s telling me to

wake up wake up

ghastly ass attitudes come to bed  
every night i go head to head  
personification fear and greed  
toss me aroun like a tumbleweed

wake up wake up

runnin around with a heart of foam  
achin and shakin i only roam  
through the ruins of the danger zone  
hell in a bathroom i have no home

in this dream i’ve been havin for weeks  
the old crone grabs me by the cheek  
pulls me close and begins to talk

i’m a beautiful body but nobody will look  
i’m a bus full o kids rollin off the dock  
i’m accused of murder but i can’t talk  
i’m allowed to leave but the door is stuck

i’m ablunt gettin smoked and i can’t wake up  
i’m a truck on a hill and i can’t stop  
im’ assuming the worst cause it always reverts  
and i’m certain that my bubble is about to burst

wake up wake up

mysteruous deats in ya family tree  
question marks in ya ancestry  
has one o yall ever died peacefully  
only ever stories o tragedy

wake up wake up

buckets of blood spilled by  
women who give the evil eye  
if i’s not a chase it’ll be a fight  
hope i never dream tonight

wake up wake up

i’m gonna change these wayward ways  
with which i’ve lived for ten thousand days  
memory is basically a stressfull haze  
runniun from the demons i’m supposed to face

wake up wake up
