[Long Hollow Equinox Festival](http://www.facebook.com/events/102025559945637/ "Equinox Facebook Page") a week from Saturday!

We will be using the new Off-the-Grid Sound System that the Emerald Coast Community of Makers are helping us put together.

Doing Bayan versions of:

2012
R U Done Yet
Dark Eyes
Swing Gitane
Feeling Our Way
Sweep The World
Wild and Bold
and a bunch more.

Weâ€™re psyched! Rinah will be there, as will Ashirah of course. They are both doing wonderfully.

Should Joey and Mike iLL really wear loin clothes?

Ah yea also Mike put up a demo of a new song about the Citizens United ruling called [Mickey Mouse Bought Up the Rights](http://soundcloud.com/madhappy/mickey-mouse-bought-up-the "Mickey Mouse Bought Up the Rights").
