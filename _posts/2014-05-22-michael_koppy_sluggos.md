Gearing up for next weeks [Sluggo’s show](https://www.facebook.com/events/1416162771994123/ "Facebook Event") with [Michael Koppy](http://www.michaelkoppy.com/ "Michael Koppy"). He’s a good example of someone who really combines music and activism.

Our friends Margaret Warren and Pat Hayes with the [Institute for Human Machine Cognition](http://www.ihmc.us "IHMC Website") here turned us onto [Concept Mapping](http://cmap.ihmc.us/ "CMAP Tools Page"), and we’ve been using it to develop our set.

Also we received another grant from the [Puffin Foundation West](http://puffinwest.org/ "Puffin West Website") to do a show in the fall. More on that later.
