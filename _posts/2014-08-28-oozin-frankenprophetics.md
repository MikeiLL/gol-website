all night oozing a a a a a acid electrified a a a a a acid oozing all night

rattling light bulb, bent beam of light  
noon o’clock peace pipe, twenty hour night.  
haven’t had a minute to mind, my own business since  
three o’clock this morning that was takin’ a hit .  
system alert reads vitamin depletion  
hope that this session is, nearing completion  
interstellar highs, and disconcerting lows  
sound of drums beating and super nova braincells so  
many revelations came and went so fast  
nothing but the blur from the future and the past  
eyes became globes of multicolored light  
and the walls became windows, and the mirrors liquid gas  
all whispered secrets, i could almost grasp  
yelled “thank y’all, think i get it at last”  
the sun rose called it, moon knew my name  
everything in the universe a, dream or a game  
all emotions a choir in my chest, till  
pain and confusion the only ones left.  
the color of a light bulb after its been fried  
perfectly describes what’s going on inside  
rattling rattled jacked up shootin’ sparks  
half resurected frankenstein loose parts

all night oozing a a a a a acid electrified a a a a a acid oozing all night  
all night oozing a a a a a acid electrified a a a a a acid oozing all night

bred to spend life pickling in a think tank  
gonna hack the code reprogram the brain bank  
balancing th’ mind body fraction ev’ry act shouldn’  
only be the product of a giant chain reaction  
we just numbered faces line of falling dominos?  
think i just figured out wow! how the equation goes:  
e=mc squared divided by  
why cubed to the power of what now?  
found the answer but it’s slated for rejection ’cause  
get a lot more use if i remembered what the question was  
wouldn’t need to wonder what the wonder was about if only we could  
only see around or through the wall of fear and doubt  
nicotine notions, unwarranted emotions  
who needs sleep when you got these magic potions  
mad more streams effervescent mind fall  
holographic images reflected by the disco ball  
saturday night fever monday morning shiver  
i become, a believer someone take me to the river and drop  
me in the waves yo i heard Isis saves  
feels like i’ve been pulled, from multiple graves  
sewn together with electrifed chain  
circuit breaker belly, fuzbox brain

all night oozing a a a a a acid electrified a a a a a acid oozing all night  
all night oozing a a a a a acid electrified a a a a a acid oozing all night

whoa what a wild, wet, windy night  
eight hundred volts an’ we’re still not fried  
still a rough ride, gettin’ to the bedside  
you asleep? wide awake. ‘least we tried  
excuse me would you lick my lightening bolt?  
The one I was throwin’ last time you was blowin’  
it’s hard bein’ a god in a hollywood world  
so glad to help, lemme lighten your load  
every so often ya gotta get off  
this planet that spins, never slows or stops  
what’d you just say? i guess i forgot.  
i think it was brilliant… of course… or not.  
gettin’ off the planet and out’ the rat race  
we can make it happen if we work as a team  
i’ll ride u an’ u ride me  
i’ll be the rhythm and u b tha beat  
i’ll be the necklace you be the beads  
i’ll be the drumming and you be the dance  
i’ll be the question u b the answer  
a yin-yang hang in the 4th dimension  
the teseract swing, the timestar stomp  
double-click soft drive digital dump
