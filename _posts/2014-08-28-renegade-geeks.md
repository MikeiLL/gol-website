This is dedicated to the underground freaks,
Hard core hippies and renegade geeks.
This goes out to the hackers and the crackers and the
Party crashers in the place to be.

Ya think you could come to understand me,
Sittin’ in front ‘ya cable TV?
Don’t care to? Well good for you.
‘Cause I wouldn’t wish that point of view,
On my worst enemy.
Your not even worthy of my apathy.
You don’t even exist as far as your concerned;
Just a pile of “feed-me”s and “what have I earned,
“From the chairman of the board?”,
An SUV. Well join the hoard.
I mean the herd. Ya prob’ly ain’t heard,
A word I’m sayin’.

This is dedicated…

Eh Eh Eh Eh Click!
Wake up, and let yourself out ‘tha cage.
Ya rush to work, stayin’ on the path,
Then ya see me dancin’ on the grass.
Ya say, “Who’s that, and what are they doin’?”,
We’re Mad Happy and we’re happy to ruin,
Your little strait world,
Like an intrusion.
A fuckin’ protrusion from beneath the illusion,
That everything is as it should be.
Top ‘o the mornin’ to ya,
Exchange pleasantries;
“How’s the family? How’s the new job?”
“My kid’s not a fag. Dig the new Saab.
Ya prob’ly ain’t heard,
A word I’m sayin’.

This is dedicated…

Don’t be seduced by the likes of me,
Into this life of poverty.
Integrity never paid one bill,
I’ll be 98 still strapped to the grill.
Gotta sell sell sell just to make one end,
When people are behaving like the North Wind.
Lord, I’m prayin’.
Ya prob’ly ain’t heard,
A word I’m sayin’.

This is dedicated…
