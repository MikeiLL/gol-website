This is the original description for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**R We Done Yet?**</span>:

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-267" class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_267" style="width: 194px">[![Original Seth Tobocman Design](https://giggleoutloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RWeDoneYet_lrg-194x300.png)](https://giggleoutloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RWeDoneYet_lrg.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-267">Seth Tobocman Design</figcaption></figure><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Are We Done Yet?</span> A two person theatre show using (international) folk music and spiritual concepts from around the world to ask a question. As a species, can we be done killing for profit? By embracing the never-ending campaign toward joy, peace, justice and freedom we gain insight into the inexhaustible value of life.

Themes include health, sexuality, commitment, education, confusion, frustration, birth, death and psychic development. The show comines music, ceremony and stand up philosophy to fearlessly honor the unique, sensual mysteries each of us is born to exemplify.
