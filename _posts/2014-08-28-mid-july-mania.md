beat, can’t sleep summer heat and the blurry vision
very weary bleary eyed tried by the television
news shows cop shows paid advertisements
late night religious nut’s spiritual advising
sending me in to a skeptic’s fit
like the end is nigh, and i think i’m down for it
who the hell is president? what does he do? what does it mean
vote for x – it’s all the same, rearrange the balls an’ chains

as if it really mattered
another night thinkin how to change the world
Lows are so low so when i get up i wanna
Lows are so low so when i get up i wanna
Lows are so low so when i get up i wanna
Lows are so low so when i get up i wanna hold it

Words keep oozing out of me like fluids out o’ corpses
threatening to drown me in neurotic neurosis
sit amongst friends silent and embarrassed
insecure beneath the weight of social paralysis
time flies. fine, i’m waitin’ta get left behind
mentally composin’ a goodbye to my dear mind
things are really comin’ to a head here what’s ahead is unclear
probably more of this wear and tear, need and fear

as if it really mattered
another night thinkin how to change the world
Lows are so low so when i get up i wanna
Lows are so low so when i get up i wanna
Lows are so low so when i get up i wanna
Lows are so low so when i get up i wanna hold it

All I’ve really been tryin a do here
is let out some pain
an’ there really aint nothin new here
just tears in the rain

the beat don’t stop till the break of dawn
walk the city streets till it’s all night long
no pity sleeps on my broken lawn
just a preacher preachin ’bout where ya been
whatcha been doin an how it’s a sin
but there’s no such thing as evil and i show no shame
hang my guilt in a gilded frame
take a look at what the cat dragged in
straight faced hustlers
n’ hard luck whores

wired, tired, un-in-spired and i

don’t know why i’m talkin cause you probably heard it all before
bet it’s been put better by a def-er dead competitor
competing for the minds ear of the disenfranchised
disenchanted literate academeans that I pine for
here the attention and respect and admiration of
anything for eternal life is that alot to ask for?
things are really coming to a head here what’s ahead is unclear
probably more o this wear n tear, n needy fear

as if it really mattered
another night thinkin how to change the world

All I’ve really been tryin a do here
is let out some pain
an’ there really aint nothin new here
just tears in the rain

lows are so low
so when i get up i wanna
lows are so low
so when i get up i wanna
lows are so low
so when i get up i wanna
lows are so low
so when i get up i want to hold it
