We were all so excited with the Grand Re-Opening of Open Books. There were tons of people in and out and they sold nearly a thousand dollars worth of merchandise, which is a lot for Open Books.

There are three Mad haPPy shows coming up:

Sunday, Feb 19th at our house with Dear Rabbit (a friend of Paleo), who is on tour from somewhere.

Tuesday, Feb 19th Mad haPPy Mike iLL show at Dragon’s Den in NOLA – Fat Tuesday, baby.

Saturday, March 10th – Mad haPPy Kids Show at End of the Line Cafe here in Pensacola. 2PM

Alabama shows in April as well as a small tour to North Carolina.
