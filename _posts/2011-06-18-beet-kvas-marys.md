As you may know we’ve gotten pretty into fermentation in our kitchen through the book, [Nourishing Traditions](http://astore.amazon.com/madhapboocol-20/detail/0967089735). Beet Kvas is a drink made by cutting up raw beats and combining them with whey, salt and water and letting it ferment in a sealed jar for a few days.

Today they had some good tomato juice for sale at the Co-op and we are all about some Beet Kvas Mary’s; Virgin for now, but some vodka is sounding pretty yummy. For spices we just threw in a little cayenne and lemon juice. Yum.
