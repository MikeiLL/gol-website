Here’s the description of a presentation Mike iLL will be delivering this week for the West Florida Public Library’s Teen Read Week.

Being a young person with a creative talent can be frustrating, but there are tactics and tools by which we can discover our own unique path toward success, responsibility, and recognition. To those who are interested in performing, writing, promoting, producing, or organizing in an artistic field, Mike “iLL” Kilmer will offer insights from his experience beginning in the 1980’s which includes a Warner Brother’s record deal and numerous independent tours and recording projects.
