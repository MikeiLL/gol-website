<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://giggleoutloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/50thBDayBlockParty-791x1024.jpg)</figure>> (We, [HBC](https://historicbrownsville.org), were going to be doing this huge neighborhood event on October 5th, 2019 where we temporarily reinstated street side parking on the big street in our neighborhood and had a big party celebrating all the awesome culture that’s here. But things got complicated and we had to cancel, or at least postpone Slowfest.)

Since that’s my 50th birthday we’re gonna have a party anyway. And we’re going to celebrate diversity and enjoy all the various ages, races, genders, sexual preferences, economic statuses and lifestyles we share with each other in Brownsville.

Please email rivkakilmer@gmail.com with any questions or if you have ideas about what to bring. We guess there will be some kind of potluck food vibe and some music. Rivka and I definitely plan to perform under our new moniker, O as in the center of wow.

Our friend Miguel Urbiztondo aka DJ Sherpa, who just moved here is gonna bring some music as well and there are some other “acts” that might play.

As noted in the image above, we are having the event behind the old Oscar’s restaurant here in Brownsville, Pensacola. Soon to be the new Taste of Jerusalem. Specifically the address is [701 N V St](https://maps.google.com/?q=701+N+V+St,+Pensacola,+FL+32505,+USA&ftid=0x8890bf3a58aa9d81:0x2f9566a54740977f).

We’ll learn more as the event gets closer.
