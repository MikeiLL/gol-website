A few years ago through our interest in International Folk Dance Music, we discovered the open source music player, [Quodlibet](https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet), and made a [little plugin for it](https://giggleoutloud.com/2016/02/02/adventures-in-quodlibet/) which records a playlist of the sessions.

Today I wanted to open the old playlists on a different computer and the solution was to copy the playlist files from the old computer `~/.quodlibet/playlists` to the new one. I also copied the plugins which are in the same location.

If you are interested in hearing some of the music from the International Folk Dance repertoire, here is a [great free resource on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/InternationalFolkDances).
